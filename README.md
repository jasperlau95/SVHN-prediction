SVHN-prediction

Use CNN to train and predict the SVHN dataset

SVHN dataset: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/

CNN: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/deep_cnn/

This project is to use the Tensorflow's tutorial of CNN(cifar10) on SVHN dataset to train a CNN model for prediction.

The test accuracy of my model is about 94% after training for nearly 5 hours on 8*Nvidia GeForce GTX Titan X GPU.(about 1600 examples/sec)
